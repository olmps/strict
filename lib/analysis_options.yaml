  # Both of the strong-mode lints are really impactful throughout the project, and both of these might be rules that you
  # may want to modify to `true` if they are too severe.
  #
  # We think that both of these rules are usually enforced in scenarios where we are manipulating untyped field/data,
  # meaning: the `dynamic` type - this means a very high opportunity to access non-existing properties and have errors
  # like NoSuchMethod, thrown while in runtime. If there is a need to use dynamic type, it would be done by explicitly
  # declaring such fields as `dynamic`.

    # To make sure that we don't have problems with `dynamic` types floating around, we set the `implicity-dynamic` to
    # `false`, meaning that we have to explicitly type your `dynamic` fields - just for type-safety measures.
